# AMP-PD RNA-Seq Explorer

Dynamic and interactive tools for exploring clinical and molecular transcriptomics data in AMP-PD developed by Craig Laboratory at USC. 

Accessible for Tier 1 and 2 users at: [https://amp-rna.uc.r.appspot.com/](https://amp-rna.uc.r.appspot.com/)


## About the workspace

Visualization tool for individual and summary level data within the Terra-based AMP-PD Knowledge Platform developed by the Craig Laboratory at USC.

The AMP-PD RNA Explorer has four primary functions:

1. **Data & Methods Links.** Used for accessing methods, downloading meta-data tables, and finding location primary data and workbooks on AMP-PD Terra. workspace.
2. **Visualization of Quality Metrics.** Visualization and exporting of quality metrics, such as principal component analysis, reads generated, batch effects, and other quality parameters.
3. **Cohort Level Differential Expression Analysis**. Visual exploration of pre-calculated cohort level analysis for differential expression, including volcano-plots.
4. **Gene/Position Level Browsing.** Exploration and downloading of individual/summary level data either by searching for a gene or by genomic position.

## Gene Browsing

Example of gene SNCA showing both a gene-level view and a genomic position view of data from AMP-PD.  Plots allow for dynamic graphic over various parameters such as visit or disease status. Underlying data can be exported to other tools, e.g. Excel.
